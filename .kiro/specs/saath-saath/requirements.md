# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Saath-Saath is a hyperlocal, voice-first B2B sourcing platform that transforms individual street food vendors into powerful Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs). The platform addresses the critical pain points of India's 10 million street vendors by aggregating their demand to unlock bulk pricing, streamlining logistics through pooled delivery, and providing access to micro-credit. The solution directly tackles the "time tax" and financial precarity that vendors face in their daily procurement process, while building a foundation for their gradual formalization into the digital economy.
